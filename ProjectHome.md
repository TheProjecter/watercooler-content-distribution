RSS is a useful format standard that allows sites to publish stories in a machine readable format. Users can subscribe to various RSS feeds on the Internet and read them in one aggregated feed using an RSS reader. Whenever a new story is posted, a small portion of the story and a headline is
retrieved by the users’ RSS reader for them to read. While RSS makes checking news convenient for users, it only works if users have instant access to an RSS reader and internet. A businessperson on the road usually does not have access
to RSS reader unless they have smart phone with an RSS reader application. Watercooler system will solve this problem by delivering RSS feeds directly to users’ cellular phones through text message or e-mail. In addition, the system
will also create dynamic home page for each user. This home page will be an online RSS reader that shows all of the RSS feeds for user and allows users to change their alert preferences. Furthermore, additional standard and non-
standard formats could be supported using a plugin system. Each plugin would parse either a standard news feed format, like RSS, or a non-standard format like an HTML or XML news webpage. In fact, a plugin could use any form of input, such as incoming mail in an email account (possibly to monitor a mailing list).
